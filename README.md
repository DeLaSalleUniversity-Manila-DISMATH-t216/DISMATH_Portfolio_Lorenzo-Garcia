## Week 1
- I was introduced to the course, DISMATH, which means Discrete Mathematics.
- 
- I learned symbols like: 
| Logical Symbol  |  Logical Operator | Shorthand | Logical Expression | Value |
| :-----: |:-------:|:-----:| :-------: | :-------: |
| ¬ |Negation | not | ¬p | opposite |
| ∧ | Conjunction | and | p ∧ q | minimum |
| v | Disjunction | or | p v q | maximum |
| ⊕ | Exclusive disjunction | xor |  p ⊕ q  ≡ (¬p ∧ q) v (p ∧ ¬q) | T iff exactly one of p and q is T, otherwise F|
| → | Conditional | if, then | p → q ≡  ¬p v q | F if p is T and q is F, otherwise T |
| ↔ | Biconditional | iff |  p ↔ q ≡ (p → q) ∧ (q → p) |  T iff p and q have the same truth values |
