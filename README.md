## Week 1
what i learned:
- I was introduced to the course, DISMATH, which means Discrete Mathematics
- I learned that Mathematical Proof is a chain of logical deductions leading to the opposition from a base set of axioms.
- Axioms, is the statement of proposition that is regarded as being established, accepted or self-evidently true.
- Proposition, is a statement which is either true or false.
- Logical deduction, is the process of reasoning from one or more statements to reach on logically certain conclusion.
- Propositional Variables represents propositions, for example is p, q.
- Propositional Expressions are expressions with variable with connectives, for example, p V q.
- Truth table is a list of all possible combination of inputs with output.
- sign "^" means minimum.
- sign "v" means maximum.
- Truth table rows is 2 raise to n, where n is number of variables.
- Conditional p->q is TRUE if both p & q are true, and p is false.
- I learned symbols like: 

| Logical Symbol  |  Logical Operator | Shorthand | Logical Expression | Value |
| :-----: |:-------:|:-----:| :-------: | :-------: |
| ¬ |Negation | not | ¬p | opposite |
| ∧ | Conjunction | and | p ∧ q | minimum |
| v | Disjunction | or | p v q | maximum |
| ⊕ | Exclusive disjunction | xor |  p ⊕ q  ≡ (¬p ∧ q) v (p ∧ ¬q) | T iff exactly one of p and q is T, otherwise F|
| → | Conditional | if, then | p → q ≡  ¬p v q | F if p is T and q is F, otherwise T |
| ↔ | Biconditional | iff |  p ↔ q ≡ (p → q) ∧ (q → p) |  T iff p and q have the same truth values |

- Normal implication is p -> q
- Inverse is when, ¬p -> ¬q
- Converse is when, q -> p
- Contrapositive is when, ¬q -> ¬p
- Biconditional is when, p <-> q which means statement is true if and only if p and q have the same truth value.

## week 2
whatr I learned:
- We learned some logical equivalences, namely:
  - Identity Laws
  - Domination Laws
  - Idempotent Laws
  - Double Negation Laws
  - Commutative Laws
  - Assosciative Laws
  - Distributive Laws
  - De Morgan's Laws
  - Absorption Laws
  - Negation Laws
- Propositional Logic deals with propositions as a whole.
- Predicate Logic is concerned not only with logic relations between sentences or propositions as whole.
- Quantifiers indicates the generality of open sentence.
- Existential Quantifier, is true if "there exist" at least only one value for x in p(x)
- Universal Quantifier, is true if "for All" possible value for x is true in p(x)
- "Mathematical Statements" are Universal Quantifier.
- Rules of Inference (Terms):
 - Argument - a sequence of statements with conclusion.
 - Valid
 - Fallacy means invalid
- Rules of Inference Tautologies:
 - Modus Ponens
 - Modus Tollens
 - Hypothetical Syllogism
 - Disjunctive Syllogism
 - Addition
 - Simplification
 - Conjunction
 - Resolution
